NOTE: Some issues with slash commands on discord app, so a possible fix is the use of testing in the web browser for [discord](https://discord.com/)!



## This is the current state of the project
Memebers need to fork this project and then clone this Repo to start!
### Brainstorming:
We thought of a couple of ideas such as:
```
Gambling bot (Blackjack, Complex slots, Roullette, Poker)
Trivia bot (Music, Common Knowledge, Movies/Shows)
Game bot (Wordle, Uno/Card Games, Connect 4)
```
These are only a few but so far we are leaning towards a mix of the game/gambling bot!


### Chosen Bot:
We have chosen the:
```
Music trivia bot!
```
Now We are in the part of finding our requirements and functions!

Requirements:

1. Trivia of selected genres of music
2. Points
3. Leaderboard
