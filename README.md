```

NOTE: Some issues with slash commands on discord app, so a possible fix is the use of testing in the web browser for [discord](https://discord.com/)!

## This is the current state of the project

Memebers need to fork this project and then clone this Repo to start!

### Brainstorming:

We thought of a couple of ideas such as:

```
Gambling bot (Blackjack, Complex slots, Roullette, Poker)
Trivia bot (Music, Common Knowledge, Movies/Shows)
Game bot (Wordle, Uno/Card Games, Connect 4)
```

These are only a few but so far we are leaning towards a mix of the game/gambling bot!

### Chosen Bot:

We have chosen the:

```
Music trivia bot!
```

Now We are in the part of finding our requirements and functions!

Requirements:

1. Trivia of selected genres of music
2. Points
3. Leaderboard


> # Version 1.0
### Arteen Ramezani - Release Notes:

```
- Added the bot trivia command:
  - When called the bot shows a preview which will contain a description and
    difficulties to pick from. Underneath the preview there are interactable
    buttons with difficulties the user can choose from which for now just displays
    music questions with multiple choice answers also as buttons. If the answer
    is correct, based on respective difficulty, the bot will "give" 1, 2, or 3 points
    to the user (tracking the points is a work in progress). If wrong, gives no points.
    Additionally after the user picks an answer, there is a display for Correct or
    Wrong which also shows the Question, Correct Answer, User's Answer, and
    the name of the question was answered by.
```
> # Version 1.02

### Jayden Elishaw - Release Notes:

#### Primary added features
- Added logging for all implemented features
- `/trivia` command now handles song previews, guessing, and multiple-choice questions tied to the currently playing iTunes track.  The old `/game` command has been removed.
- Logs to terminal for debugging voice/HTTP/command execution

##### Pre-Build commands (new)
-Run these once to set up environment (installs new discordJS version and FFMPEG)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
npm i discord.js@^14
npm i -D @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

##### Build commands (new)
- Source files live under `src/`
- `npm run build` runs esbuild:
  - Bundles/transpiles JS
  - Outputs CommonJS modules into `build/`
  - Preserves folder structure via `--outbase=src`

##### Runtime commands (same)
- `npm start` runs:
  1) build

### ArteenR Changes:
```
- Enforced 15‑second answer window after each preview; unanswered rounds end
  automatically.
- Tested skip functionality but chose to remove.
- Added hint feature, needs to still be cleaned up.
- Modified replay button; limited to one use per song and restarts the timer.
- Added a hint button (one use per round) that does not affect the timer.
- After each round ends there is a 5‑second pause before the next preview begins.
- Difficulty selection descriptions updated to match question types:
  easy=artist/genre, medium=album/title, hard=year.
- Fixed crash caused by overly long button IDs by using numeric indices.
- Questions are all relevant to the song being played
- Ensured a round only moves on after the previous round is over
- Cleaned up Gameplay loop
```

> # Version 2.0.1
> ### Maintenance update
### ArteenR Changes:
```
- Multiple-choice questions now strictly respect the selected difficulty;
  easy rounds only ask about artist/genre, medium about album/title, hard
  about release year.  This prevents irrelevant answer options.
- Hints are generated based on the actual question type instead of always
  showing artist/title initials; the API now supports `track`,`artist`,`genre`,
  `album`, and `year` hints.
- Added `/terminate` slash command (admin only) which immediately ends a
  running trivia game and announces the termination to the channel.
- Added tests covering the new hint logic, and difficulty constraints.
- Updated normalization utility used in tests to collapse extra whitespace.
```
