NOTE: Some issues with slash commands on discord app, so a possible fix is the use of testing in the web browser for [discord](https://discord.com/)!

## This is the current state of the project

Memebers need to fork this project and then clone this Repo to start!

### Brainstorming:

We thought of a couple of ideas such as:

```
Gambling bot (Blackjack, Complex slots, Roullette, Poker)
Trivia bot (Music, Common Knowledge, Movies/Shows)
Game bot (Wordle, Uno/Card Games, Connect 4)
```

These are only a few but so far we are leaning towards a mix of the game/gambling bot!

### Chosen Bot:

We have chosen the:

```
Music trivia bot!
```

Now We are in the part of finding our requirements and functions!

Requirements:

1. Trivia of selected genres of music
2. Points
3. Leaderboard


> # Version 1.0
### Arteen Ramezani - Release Notes:

```
- Added the bot trivia command:
  - When called the bot shows a preview which will contain a description and
    difficulties to pick from. Underneath the preview there are interactable
    buttons with difficulties the user can choose from which for now just displays
    music questions with multiple choice answers also as buttons. If the answer
    is correct, based on respective difficulty, the bot will "give" 1, 2, or 3 points
    to the user (tracking the points is a work in progress). If wrong, gives no points.
    Additionally after the user picks an answer, there is a display for Correct or
    Wrong which also shows the Question, Correct Answer, User's Answer, and
    the name of the question was answered by.
```
> # Version 1.02

### Jayden Elishaw - Release Notes:

#### Primary added features
- Added logging for all implemented features
- `/game` command: joins voice channel `Game`, downloads a random iTunes 30s preview, plays it, cleans up, leaves voice, then runs a 30s countdown message in `#game` and finally reveals the track name
- Logs to terminal for debugging voice/HTTP/command execution

##### Pre-Build commands (new)
-Run these once to set up environment (installs new discordJS version and FFMPEG)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
npm i discord.js@^14
npm i -D @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

##### Build commands (new)
- Source files live under `src/`
- `npm run build` runs esbuild:
  - Bundles/transpiles JS
  - Outputs CommonJS modules into `build/`
  - Preserves folder structure via `--outbase=src`

##### Runtime commands (same)
- `npm start` runs:
  1) build
  2) `node -r dotenv/config build/app.js`
